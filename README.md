# JustAnotherSandGameClassic

*This was the very first video game I ever developed! As you can imagine, the code/file organization is very, very messy. However, I've uploaded it here in case anyone was curious about how it worked. You can download the game on [itch.io](https://kingtut-10101.itch.io/just-another-sand-game "itch.io").*

A small game I made with LOVE2D. It features 36 unique elements, including water, slime, quicksand, and more!

I made this project so I could get accustomed to the LOVE2D framework. Admittedly, many parts of the game are not well programmed, but hopefully this shouldn't impact performance too much.
